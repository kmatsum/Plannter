## Configuration

Defaults for harvesting and planting range for each crop are set based off of the most recent first spring frost date and the last fall frost date. All plants in the database are from the Clyde’s Garden Planner slider sheet used for reference for making this app. All new plants and their corresponding information may be added in the Crop Info page. All frost dates may be changed in the settings menu, and those changes will then affect the planting and harvesting range for all crops in the database. You may remove individual plants via their corresponding page in Crop Info. You may also reset the database to its original plant values in the Settings page. No other configuration is necessary.

## How to Install
* In the project’s current state, the application can only be installed onto a physical device through Android Studio or via the provided apk file.
* The APK file for each Plannter version can be found in the **/Plannter APK Packages** folder
* The application can also be run on the Android Studio emulator, which can be accomplished once the emulator has been created by opening the project in Android Studio and pressing the green play button after the build has finished. To install the application using Android Studio, you must have your physical device connected to the computer via a USB cable and have downloaded Google USB Driver from the SDK Manager. You may also install it over Wifi. More information about debugging can be found [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb).

* The clipart banner at the bottom of the START page is not ours and we do not own it. When Plannter goes onto the app store, all images will be replaced with our own images that we will pay to be created for us
* All plant timelines and calculations are based off of [Clyde’s Garden Planner](https://www.clydesvegetableplantingchart.com/). Before we go commercial, we will contact Clyde and figure out licensing in order to put the application on the Google Play Store
